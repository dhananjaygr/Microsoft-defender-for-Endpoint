# Microsoft Defender for Endpoint 

## Overview

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is an advanced threat protection solution designed to help organizations secure their endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, and servers. Formerly known as Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), it is a part of the Microsoft Defender suite of security products. 

### Key features of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint

1. **Endpoint Security:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint focuses on securing endpoints, which are individual devices within an organization's network. This includes protection for Windows-based devices, macOS, Linux, and mobile devices.

2. **Threat Protection:** The solution offers comprehensive threat protection by utilizing a combination of advanced threat intelligence, machine learning, and behavioural analysis. It helps identify and block a wide range of sophisticated threats, including malware, ransomware, and zero-day exploits.

3. **Advanced Analytics:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint includes advanced analytics capabilities, allowing organizations to gain insights into their security posture. It provides detailed reports and analytics to help security teams understand the nature of threats and take proactive measures.

4. **Automated Investigation and Response:** One of the key features is its ability to automate threat investigation and response. The platform can detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents automatically, reducing the workload on security teams and accelerating the response time.

5. **Threat and Vulnerability Management:** The solution provides tools for managing and mitigating vulnerabilities within the organization. It helps prioritize and remediate security vulnerabilities on endpoints to reduce the attack surface.

6. **Integration with Microsoft 365 Security Center:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integrates seamlessly with the Microsoft 365 Security Center. This integration enables security teams to have a centralized view of security incidents and manage security policies across various Microsoft 365 services.

7. **Real-time Security Alerts:** The platform delivers real-time security alerts to ensure that organizations are promptly informed about potential security threats. These alerts enable security teams to take immediate action to protect their network.

8. **Continuous Monitoring:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint operates in real-time, providing continuous monitoring of endpoint activities. This constant vigilance helps detect and respond to threats as they emerge, ensuring a proactive approach to security.

9. **Compliance and Secure Configuration:** The solution helps organizations achieve and maintain compliance with industry standards and regulations. It also assists in enforcing secure configurations on endpoints to align with best security practices.

10. **Cloud-Powered Security:** Leveraging Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, Defender for Endpoint benefits from the scalability and intelligence of the cloud. This ensures that organizations have access to the latest threat intelligence and updates in real-time.


## Sandbox Scenario
Contoso Corporation, strategically implements Defender for Endpoint, which provides visibility into devices in your environment, offers vulnerability management to help you better understand your cyberattack surface, and delivers endpoint protection, endpoint detection and response (EDR), mobile cyber threat protection, and managed hunting in a single platform.

## About the Sandbox

Using this environment, you'll be able to explore complete features and offerings offered by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Please find the detailed overview of the sandbox environment below.

### Pre-provisioned resources

#### **Virtual Machines:**

- 1 *Windows Server 2022 Datacenter* and 1 *Windows 11* Virtual machines, virtual machine-related resources like Virtual networks, Network security groups, managed disks, Network interface cards, and IP addresses are deployed as part of the automation.

  These virtual machines are tailored and configured to the sandbox's specifications. Files, applications, packages, and OS configurations are all pre-configured. It is recommended that you use the same virtual machine throughout the lab for the best experience.

#### **License and subscription:**

- You'll have access to a pre-configured Microsoft user account with an active Azure subscription, a tenant, and a Microsoft 365 E5 license assigned to the user. 
   
  User account has assigned as Owner at subscription and Global administrator at the tenant level. You need to use the same user account throughout the lab to get the most out of the lab. 

#### **Azure Credits:**

- You have been given Azure credit of **$83 USD** which includes the running cost of pre-deployed Azure resources, license cost, and other Azure resources deployed while running through the lab.

  You will receive **cost alerts** to your registered email address at **50%/75%/90%/95%/100%** of the allotted Azure Credit is spent.

  You can visit the Azure Subscription page to check the current Azure credit spend and Analysis on **Cost analysis** tab under the Cost Management option.

#### **Duration and Deletion of sandbox:**  

- The sandbox environment will be active for **30 days/730** hours from the time of registration. 
- The maximum allowed virtual machine uptime is only **40 hours**. It is recommended to deallocate the virtual machine when not in use.
- The virtual machine is set up with a custom feature called Idle start/stop. This custom package will check the virtual machine's idleness every **2 hours/120 minutes**. If the virtual machine is left idle for over 2 hours, a pop-up window will appear, prompting you to respond. If you do not take action within 10 minutes, the virtual machine will shut down automatically.  This feature is enabled in virtual machines to optimize Azure costs.
- when 100% of Azure credits are spent, the sandbox environment will get automatically deleted without any prior notification. To retain the environment for a longer period and to get the most out of the environment, please follow the best practices mentioned below.

#### **Best practices:** 

- **Resources usage**: Please stop the virtual machines and other resources when not in use to minimize the Azure spend.

- **Azure Cost Analysis**: Maintain a practice of checking the Cost Analysis report of the assigned Azure subscription often in check the Azure spending so that the environment can be retained for a longer duration of time.

- **Alert notifications**: Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails. Alerts give you can head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible.
